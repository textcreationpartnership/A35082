            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66009:3"/> of tho≈øe Gentlemen that were called to the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they met accordingly in the <hi>Councell</hi> Chamber, where being entred the Room, above one hundred and twenty in number, and being ≈øet round about the Table, the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ≈øtanding by the window oppo≈øite to the middle of the Table and having as many of the Army-Officers as the room could well contein, on his right hand and on his left, his Lord≈øhip made a very grave Chri≈øtian and ≈øea≈øonable ≈øpeech and Exhortation, wherein he breifly recounted the many great and wondrous mercyes of God towards this Nation, and the Series of providence wherein the pre≈øence of God did wonderfully appear in carrying on this Cau≈øe, and bringing affaires into the pre≈øent condition, beyond all expectation; a≈øcribing the glory of all to God alone.</p>
               <p>He ≈øet forth al≈øo in particular the progre≈ø≈øe of affaires ≈øince the famous victory at <hi>Worce≈øter,</hi> wherein that Arch Enemy of this nation was wholly ≈øubdued.

               <p>Moreover, he very amply held forth the clearene≈ø≈øe of the Call given to the pre≈øent Members to take the Supream Authority, and did from the Scriptures exhort them to their duties and incourage them therein, de≈øiring that a tendernes might be u≈øed towards all godly and con≈øcientious per≈øons, of what judgment and under what form ≈øoever.</p>
               <p>Which being ended, his Lord≈øhip produced an in≈øtrument under his own hand and ≈øeale, wherby he did with the advi≈øe of his Officer, devolve and entru≈øt the Supream Authority and Government of this Common-wealth, into the hands of the per≈øons then met, who or any forty of them are to be held and acknowledged the Supream Authority of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unto whom all per≈øons within the ≈øame, and the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereunto belonging are to yeild obedience and ≈øubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>THis night was a great Mutiny at the <hi>New Exchange</hi> in the Strand, ≈øuch as hath ≈øcarce ever been the like: The bu≈øine≈ø≈øe upon the be≈øt information that I can have from tho≈øe who were pre≈øent in part of the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and have conferred with others upon the whole, is this.</p>
               <p>On Munday night (which was the night before) three of the Portugall Amba≈ø≈øadours family, whereof his brother was one, being at the New Exchange, they talking in <hi>French</hi> ≈øpake of ≈øuch di≈øcour≈øe of Tran≈øactions of ≈øome Engli≈øh Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, which Col. <hi>Gerhard,</hi> Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerhards</hi> brother, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding the French Tongue, hearing, told them very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66009:7"/> that they did not repre≈øent the ≈øtories they ≈øpake of right; whereupon one of the Portugalls gave him the lie, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they began to ju≈øtle, and all three fell upon Col. <hi>Gerhard,</hi> and threw him down, and got upon him, but tho he be but a little man, yet he threw him off that was upon him, and ≈øo was bu≈øtling with him a good while; there were ≈øome Gentlemen there, but knew not who it was they ≈øo a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaulted, and ≈øo ne'r medled with them, and yet one of the Portugalls with his Dagger ≈øtab'd Col. <hi>Gerhard</hi> in the ≈øhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and hurt him ≈øore; but afterwards Mr. <hi>Anfrazer</hi> ≈øpake to the Portugalls, that it was not civill nor hand≈øome for ≈øo many to fall upon one, three to one being very unequall, and endeavoured to pull one of them off, and ≈øo to per≈øwade them to cea≈øe, and thereby he came to ≈øee who it was they had a≈ø≈øaulted, who finding it to be Col. <hi>Gerhard</hi> which he knew well, and ≈øeeing them ≈øtill pur≈øue their rage upon him, he drew to relieve him, and after ≈øome bu≈øtle the Portugalls went away, one of them having a cut upon his cheek; and that night afterwards near twenty of their Attendants came to the Exchange, and would have quarrel'd with any body, and ≈øome cuffing there was by ≈øome, but not much more that night, for it was late, and they returned home.</p>
               <p>On Tue≈øday night, came about fifty of the Portugalls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the New Exchange, of which number were the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øadours brother, and two Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> and they were led on by a Portugall in Buffe, whom they call Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, one well known to ≈øome in the Exchange, and they had generally double Arms, all or mo≈øt part of them ≈øwords and pi≈øtolls, and coats of Male, or Armour, ≈øome one thing, ≈øome another, to pre≈øerve their bodies from ≈øwords entring upon them. They had al≈øo two or three Coaches that brought Ammunition, in which were hand Granadoes and Bottles, and ≈øome little barrells of powder, and bullets, and other nece≈ø≈øaries if occa≈øion was. They had al≈øo ≈øome Boats ready to attend them at the water ≈øide, if occa≈øion was for them al≈øo.</p>
               <p>Thus they came with a re≈øolution to fall upon every Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh Gentleman they ≈øhould find in or about the Exchange;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66009:7"/> and entring in with this equipage the people were exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frighted. For fir≈øt came in the Captaine in the Buffe, who led them, and after him the Portugall Amba≈ø≈øadors brother, and the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> and ≈øo the re≈øt, all with drawn ≈øwords, and in ≈øo furious a po≈øture, as if they intended to kill every body they met with, that ≈øtood before them.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the people fled into the ≈øhops in the Exchange to ≈øhelter them≈øelves, and all that did not ≈øo they fell upon, though no man gave them the lea≈øt affront, yet they pi≈øtol'd and cut, and wounded many.</p>

It is al≈øo to be noted, that God did even mark out this Portugall for Ju≈øtice; for when he e≈øcaped out of Newgate at fir≈øt, he was immediately found out: and now having by Order of the Court been remanded to the Keeper of Newgate, he was very near an e≈øcape thence againe, but the Lord prevented him: For ye≈øternight, being Lords day at night, a new plot
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66009:22"/> was laid for his e≈øcaping by two women, one was Mrs. <hi>Gourdon</hi> who brought another woman, who under her womans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell had a Foot-boys ≈øuit on; the womans cloths being taken off, they dre≈øt up the <hi>Don</hi> in them, and ≈øo he came down with Mrs. <hi>Gourdon,</hi> to to the door, where the Keeper narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prying under the hood, di≈øcovered the fraud, and ≈øpoyled the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. This failing, and the hour of execution next day approaching, he was conveyed from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Tower hill</hi> in a Coach and ≈øix Hor≈øes in mourning having divers of of his Brothers retinue with him, much lamenting his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Being upon the Scaffold, he ≈øpake ≈øomewhat to tho≈øe that under≈øtood him, in excu≈øe of his offence, laying the blame of the quarrell and murther upon the Engli≈øh. So after ≈øome few private words and pa≈ø≈øages of Popi≈øh devotion with his Confe≈ø≈øor, he ≈øurrendred to him his Beads and Crucifix, and his Head to the Block, which was chopt off with ≈øomewhat more then a ≈øingle blow. The re≈øt condemned about th t murther, were reprieved all, ≈øave an Iri≈øh man, who was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted al≈øo this day early in the morning, at Tiborn.</p>
               <p>In the morning al≈øo of this day, the Articles of Peace being fully concluded betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Portugall,</hi> were ≈øigned by the ≈øaid Amba≈ø≈øador, and immediately thereupon he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from his hou≈øe out of Town.</p>
               <p>It plea≈øed his Highne≈ø≈øe to reprieve <hi>Somer≈øet Fox,</hi> becau≈øe of his ingenuous confe≈ø≈øion, but this day the other two were executed for their Trea≈øons again≈øt his Highnes and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. <hi>Vowel</hi> a School-ma≈øter, was in the morning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted upon a Gallows at <hi>Charing-Cro≈ø≈øe,</hi> and in the ≈øame place it was expected <hi>Gerhard</hi> ≈øhould have ≈øuffered the ≈øame death, but he had the favour granted him to loo≈øe his head: <hi>Vowel</hi> ≈øpake little of the crime for which he ≈øuffered, but the main of his di≈øcour≈øe was to proclaim how great a Zelot he was to the old way of Religion, and to the cau≈øe of the late King and his family; wherein he let fall divers expre≈ø≈øions tending to ≈øedition, and few of repentance for his fault touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he would not ≈øpeak out, but willed the Executioner to doe his Office, and ≈øo after halfe an hours hanging he was cut down, and conveyed away in a Coach.</p>
